# Agentpolis

Agentpolis is a fully agent-based platform for modeling transportation systems. It comprises a high-performance discrete-event simulation core, a cohesive set of high-level abstractions for building extensible agent-based models and a library of predefined components frequently used in transportation and mobility models. Together with a suite of supporting tools, Agentpolis enables rapid prototyping and execution of data-driven simulations of a wide range of mobility and transportation phenomena.
